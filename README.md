# Practest 5 - Simulate spread of disease 

- `pracTest5.py`
  - This file takes the transmission and recovery rate from command line argument and simulate using the `simlength` variable
  - At every iteration it generates a image and stores in the directory.
- `test5Sweep.sh`
  - The script uses nested for loop to experiment the simulation by various combination of variable `r` (transimission rate) and `a` (recovery rate). It also saves the outputs in a csv file.

## Requirements
Three packages needs to be installed to run the program.
```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install notebook
```
## How to run 
- For the script you have to make the script executable 
```bash
sudo chmod +x test5Sweep.sh
```
- The script needs six argument 
```bash
./test5Sweep.sh <low_r> <high_r> <step_r> <low_a> <high_a> <step_a>
```
  - <low_r> : lower limit of transmission rate
  - <high_r>: upper limit transmission rate
  - <step_r>: step of transimission rate increase at each iteration
  - <low_a> : lower limit recovery rate rate
  - <high_a>: upper limit of transmission rate
  - <step_a>: step of recovery rate increase at each iteration
  - Example:
```bash
./test5Sweep.sh 0.002 0.0025 0.0001 0.4 0.5 0.1
```
  - The script will generate a new folder and .csv files with images in a directory
  - In `pracTest5.ipynb` file `pd.readcsv()` needs to  be modified by putting a csv file name that is generated by the script to show the plot.
